<h2>Description and Planning</h2>

<div class="post">
  <p>
We are trying to make an alien game with Pygamezero and Python. When we started, we didn't know what the game was going to be. We followed pygame zero tutorials. We first read the paragraphs and then copy-paste the code snippets from the tutorial in our game code. To make learning exciting, sometimes we added cool stuff to the code ourselves when it didn’t say to do that. 
</p>

<p>
Let's talk about Python first. Python is a programming language that you can code on windows or mac. It was developed by Guido Van Rossum. Python was released in 1991, python is used for data science and writing system scripts. The reason why we picked Python is because we found a really good game development library that is easy for beginners. 
</p>

<p>
Pygamezero is a code library used for teaching school students or kids to make a game and learn code. 
</p>

<p>
Initially, me and my father have learnt how to change the direction of the alien. We made it go sideways, up and down and diagonal. When you click the alien it says Bilal is a champ but when you miss it says you missed me. We have also learnt x and y-axis, x is horizontal and y is vertical. We can also control the speed of the alien, we have done all of this with Pygamezero.
</p>

<p>
First few things we did, when we started making our game, were researching and reading. We decided to make a game using Pygamezero. Pygamezero wasn’t too hard to make a game for me because I already have some experience with Python. After we learnt how to code basic coding skills we started doing some more complex coding. When I learnt that I added some writing at the top left corner that says score = 0 and lives = 5. If you click on the alien you would hear it say eep and you get 5 points which increase the score by 5 points but if you miss it you lose a life. Once you lose all your lives you hear a fire alarm noise and the alien wouldn’t be on the screen. The next thing we will probably do is when the game ends it says game over, or we could add a picture of the alien dancing.

Soon we'll be publishing the video for this game. Please stay tuned for more updates on the blog.

<h2>Description and Planning</h2>

<div class="post">
  <p>
    We wanted to draw something with Dash. We found some articles about how to draw with dash. We started following their instructions. We found 2 lego connectors in our dash package. We attached it to dash, there were a couple of places to put it. Then we started searching for lego peices in our my lego collection. We couldn't be able to find the most of the lego peices required. So we basicly designed and created our own marker holder.

    We started moving dash on paper, but we found out that dash is not good at moving on paper. So we changed our plan and bought small whiteboard from kmart with markers.
